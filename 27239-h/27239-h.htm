<p>&ldquo;<span class = "firstword">What</span> is my little Alfred
crying for?&rdquo; asked his mother, Mrs. Clifford, as she entered the
room where Alfred stood weeping by the table. <!-- open quote missing
--> Come here, and tell me what is the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfred slowly advanced towards his mother, and wiped away his tears
with her apron. Alfred was but a little boy, or he would not have cried
for such a simple thing as he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Alfred, and what is it?&rdquo; asked his kind mamma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mamma, you know that nice plum cake you gave me for
saying my lesson well; I&nbsp;had put it in the cupboard, as I did not
want to eat it then, and I came just now to take a little nibble at it;
and when I opened the closet-door to look for it, there was an ugly
brown mouse in the closet, and hardly a scrap of my cake left; that
greedy thing had eaten it all but a few crumbs.&rdquo; And here
Alfred&rsquo;s tears flowed afresh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, my dear child, that the mouse has eaten your
cake; but still, I&nbsp;do not think&nbsp;it
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
was worth shedding so many tears about: you must learn to bear such
trifling disappointments with more patience. I&nbsp;dare say, the mouse
has eaten my sugar and cake, but I shall not cry if it has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is enough to make any one cry, (said Alfred).
I&nbsp;only wish, (added he, his eyes sparkling with anger), that I
could have killed the little beast for stealing my cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Alfred, I am ashamed of you,&rdquo; said his mother
gravely.</p>

<p>Alfred could, however, think of nothing but the loss of his cake, and
begged his mother to let the mouse-trap be set to catch the mischievous
intruder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford was very sorry to hear her little son talk so, and she
represented to him his cruelty in wanting to take away the life of a
poor mouse only for having satisfied its hunger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, mice do a deal of mischief, (said Alfred), and
ought to be killed; for that mouse will soon eat up all your
sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Alfred; I know a certain two-legged mouse, who, if I left
the key in my store-closet, would eat more sugar in one minute than this
poor little animal could in an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfred hung his head at this reproof, for it was but a day or two
since he was detected at the sugar dish; and he soon after left the
room.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<p>Mrs. Clifford was much grieved that her little Alfred shewed so much
inclination to be cruel and revengeful, two qualities so dangerous in a
child, or in any one; and she knew that, unless it was timely checked,
it would grow into a habit. Harsh means, she did not like to adopt; and
so she at last thought of a method which seemed likely to succeed. She
was well aware of the inconvenience of having mice in her cupboard, as
they not only commit great depredations, but soil every thing they
touch; so, as she was forced to kill the mouse, she hoped to turn its
death to a good use. Therefore, the next time Alfred entered the room,
she asked him if he was still resolved to have the mouse killed.
&ldquo;Yes, mamma, (replied Alfred), it had no right to eat my
cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; I will have the mouse-trap set; but observe,
Alfred, whether before the day is past, you do not tell me you are sorry
for its death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no; that I am sure I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied
Alfred, and Mrs. Clifford ordered the trap to be set.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, when Mrs. Clifford came down stairs and went
to the closet, she beheld her poor little prisoner dead in his wire
cage. &ldquo;See, Alfred, (said she), here is the poor mouse
dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfred at first was glad; but when he saw what a pretty one it was,
he was sorry, but contented himself by saying to the dead mouse,
&ldquo;If you had
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
not been in the cupboard doing so much mischief, you would not have been
killed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had said his lesson, his mother said to him, &ldquo;Now,
Alfred, shall I tell you a story?&rdquo; Alfred was very fond of hearing
a story, if it was not too long, and he asked his mother, if this would
be a long one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to tire you, (said his mother), so I will
only tell you part of it this morning. <!-- close quote missing -->
Alfred fetched his little stool, and having placed it at her side, fixed
his eyes on her face while she related</p>


<h4>THE HISTORY OF A FIELD MOUSE.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;<span class = "firstword">In</span> a wheat-stack, in Farmer
Ball&rsquo;s yard, lived an old mouse with her family, consisting of
five little ones, the most worthy of which was a pretty brown mouse,
called Downy, because her fur was longer and softer than either of her
brothers and sisters, and besides being the prettiest, she was likewise
the wisest and best among them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother was by birth a field-mouse; she had been carried
among the sheaves of wheat into the stack, with a great many more
field-mice; and had lived there, at the expence of farmer Ball, ever
since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was one fine clear morning, in the middle of March, that,
as Downy was peeping her little nose out of the straw at the edge of the
stack, to breathe a little fresh air, she saw the farmer with his men
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
enter the yard, and heard him tell the people that he would have the
stack taken into the barn and thrashed, and desired them to bid Fen, the
ratcatcher, come, and bring all his dogs with him.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/p09.jpg" width = "329" height = "296"
alt = "mice in the farmyard">

<p>&ldquo;Poor Downy was in a terrible fright at hearing this; she ran
to acquaint her mother with it; and asked her what they had best do; but
her mother, who was but a foolish mouse, bade her not be under the least
alarm, for she was persuaded the farmer did not mean to take it in just
then; and added, it was time enough to think of it when the men began;
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
she told Downy to go to bed with the rest of her brothers and sisters,
and not to be afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But poor Downy was in great trouble about what she should do,
and could not sleep for thinking of the sad fate which threatened them;
she awakened her companions to consult with them; but her sisters only
laughed at her fear, and said, they would never leave a place where they
were so well off; and where they could get plenty of good corn, only for
the trouble of eating it. Her brothers were of the same opinion, and
added, they could run so swiftly, they were sure they could soon get
away into the field; but they expected they should live very quietly yet
for some time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor foolish little things! they did not think the danger was
so near; but they were awakened the next morning by the farmer&rsquo;s
men unroofing the stack, and they now wished they had hearkened to the
prudent advice of their sister Downy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Downy&rsquo;s heart almost died within her, when
she heard the barking of the dogs, and the hallooing of the men; how
much rather would she have been in the field, than in the warm stack!
for she heard the men drawing near to the place where they lay; and they
were all terribly afraid; and their mother, the old mouse, would go to
see how far the danger was from them. Imprudent creature! she ventured
too near; for a great black dog on the
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
top of the stack, the moment the men raised the sheaf where she was,
snapped her up in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing was now to be heard but shrieks and cries from every
side of the stack; and the men drew nearer and nearer: Downy heard the
last cries of her brethren; the sheaf where she had taken refuge, was
already on the point of being raised, when she sprang through an opening
in the side, and was just going to run down, when she beheld a great dog
directly under her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Downy gave herself up as lost, and awaited in trembling
anxiety her fate: for some moments she clung to the outside of the
stack, not daring to descend, yet fearing still more to stay; when,
luckily for our poor little mouse, some one called the dog, who
instantly ran off; and Downy, darting from the stack, had just time to
gain a place of security beneath a clod of earth, where she lay shaking
with fear, not daring to look up for some minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shuddered with horror when she heard the dying groans of
her friends in the stack, and the shouts of the men encouraging the
dogs; many a poor mouse did she see running away in hopes of making its
escape, but pursued and devoured by the dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several times poor Downy had like to have been discovered by
the dogs, or crushed beneath the horses&rsquo; feet, but she crouched
very close to the ground, and lay so still, she hardly breathed, so
great was her
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
fear; at length she watched an opportunity, when no one was near, to
quit her retreat, and ran with all the speed she could, not once daring
to pause or look behind, till she gained the farmer&rsquo;s orchard;
where she laid among the long grass, panting, and half dead with terror
and fatigue; she hid herself toward night under the roots of an old
apple-tree; for she was very much afraid of a great white owl which she
had seen flying near.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/p12.jpg" width = "330" height = "292"
alt = "mouse hiding from owl">

<p>&ldquo;It was in vain for her to lament the sad fate of her mother
and brethren; she could not recal them to life; and Downy was thankful
that she had
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
escaped so well; but the cold weather was not gone yet, and poor little
Downy knew she had nothing to eat and no warm house to live in; but must
make herself one; and she was afraid she should be starved to death with
hunger, or die with cold. These thoughts occupied her mind, till she
fell asleep, nor did she awake next morning till quite late, and found
herself very hungry. She first peeped out of her hole, and seeing
nothing near to hurt her, she ventured forth in search of some food; she
rummaged among the dead leaves for some time, without success, till
chance led her to a row of nut-trees; here, after a diligent search, she
had the good fortune to discover three nuts, one of which she eat, being
very hungry, and the rest she carried home to her tree; but Downy knew
they would not last long, and so thought it best to try and get more,
she therefore deposited them safely away, and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged; 'set off' occurs only once">sat off</ins> to
look for more provisions; she spent nearly the whole day among the
nut-trees, but returned home only with one nut; and a shower of snow
falling, she was forced to return to her dwelling, and did not go out
any more that day, but laid still, and thought how she should make
herself a warm nest; for she was very cold here, having been used to the
close warm stack, where scarce any air entered. She eat very sparingly
of her nuts, saving as much as possible for the morrow, fearing lest the
snow should hinder
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
her looking for more; but there had not fallen much, and in the morning,
the sun coming out quite bright, melted it all; and Downy left her tree
to look for something to line her nest with, and for more food. That
being the first object, she began to search for some first, and was more
fortunate than before, as she discovered several ears of corn, which had
been blown by the wind off the stack; she could hardly credit her good
fortune, when she beheld her store and saw it all safely lodged in her
granary. Her next care was to line her nest; for this purpose, (though
it was very cold and frosty) she collected all the bits of dried moss
and grass she could find, and carried them in her mouth to her new
habitation; she nibbled off the fibres which hung to the roots of the
tree, and dried weeds, and soon made her house quite warm and
comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She spent the remainder of the month of March, and the
beginning of April, in laying up stores of provision, and in enlarging
the inside of her house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spring began with some beautiful warm days, and everything
looked cheerful and gay; the crocusses were all in flower, and the
primroses, and snow-drops, with some early violets. Downy was rejoiced
when she saw the daisies in the orchard begin to shew their white heads
above the grass, and she took many a frisk out to enjoy the sunshine,
and was quite happy and content.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<p>&ldquo;One fine evening as she was returning to her house, she saw a
creature much like a weasel, only somewhat smaller, which she knew to be
a mousehunt, by what she had heard of them: he was prowling along close
by her tree, in hopes of catching her; he smelt about some time, and at
last went in. Poor little Downy was in a sad fright; she knew not what
to do, for she saw his head peeping out of her hole, and his cunning
black eye looking round in every direction.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/p15.jpg" width = "332" height = "295"
alt = "mouse hiding from weasel">

<p>&ldquo;When little Downy saw the mousehunt take possession
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
of her house, she knew she must not venture there again, and was in
great distress, as to where she should pass the night securely; at last
she found a hole in the bank, and into this she crept, though very much
alarmed for fear of her enemy&rsquo;s discovering her; she dared not go
to sleep at all that night; nor did she stir out next day, till forced
by hunger to seek for food; she did not see any thing of the mousehunt,
but she resolved to leave the orchard and seek a safer spot for her new
habitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, next day, she <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged; 'set off' occurs only once">sat off</ins> to look for a
proper situation; she passed through the orchard hedge into a beautiful
green meadow, all covered with daisies, red clover, cowslips, and golden
buttercups. Here Downy resolved to find a place to live in: and she
whisked about under the tall heads of the cowslips and buttercups; at
last she fixed on a little green mound, such an one as you, Alfred, call
a fairy&rsquo;s throne, and here she began to scratch with her fore
feet, till she had made a little opening in the turf, and she used such
diligence, that before night she had made a hole large enough to sleep
in, and though it was not lined or so warm as her house under the old
apple-tree, yet she slept so sound that she never awoke till the sun had
risen quite high in the heavens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Downy jumped up in a hurry when she saw how late it was: the
birds had been up hours before her,
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
and were all busily employed building their nests; every bush resounded
with the songs of these little creatures while at work, and Downy knew
she must not be idle, for she had much to do; being very hungry she
first went to an oak which grew at some little distance, and here she
found plenty of acorns among the leaves&mdash;of these she made a hearty
meal, and carried some to where she was at work. With a great deal of
care and labour she dug her house and made it quite round and smooth, as
she went on, carrying it in a slanting direction along the hollow side
of the hill. It cost poor Downy many a long day&rsquo;s hard work before
her house was completed, and many a weary nibble before she had finished
lining the inside of it. Her next care was to make a secure room for
stowing away her winter stores; for this purpose, she made an opening on
one side of her first room, and carried a passage along some little
distance, and then formed her store chamber, which she was a long time
making, but it was at length completed perfectly to her own
satisfaction, having rendered it a most convenient granery. She had now
nothing to do but find feed for herself, and play, but Downy never came
home without bringing something useful for her house, either a bit of
straw or hay, a&nbsp;little tuft of moss, or the dried stalk of a
flower; these she cut with her teeth into little bits, and laid in her
nest to make it soft and warm.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<p>&ldquo;Downy was now quite happy, her <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads 'monnd'">mound</ins> was all covered with flowers, fine
cowslips, and butter-cups, and tuft of daisies grew close to the
entrance of her house, and served to hide it from the eyes of owls,
mousehunts, or any of the enemies to poor mice; and Downy thought
herself quite secure from all dangers: of a beautiful moonlight night
she used just to peep out from under the daisies, and look at the dew
drops all shining like diamonds in the moon-beams, and once she whisked
on to the top of her green mount, and began to play among the flowers,
but she was alarmed by the sight of a small dog running through the high
grass, and she quickly retreated into her house; nor was she so
imprudent again as venture out after it grew dusk. And now the grass
grew long and high, the flowers began to lose their beauty, and turn
brown; every thing proclaimed the approach of summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The month of June began, and the mowers came to cut down the
grass; Downy was fearful that they would molest her, and spoil her
house, when they came near the little mount; but she trusted to the
chance that they might not discover it, and she laid quite close all
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But poor little Downy was very sorry to see all the nice high
grass and pretty flowers cut down to the ground, those flowers which had
sheltered her from the sun and rain for so long.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/p19.jpg" width = "337" height = "304"
alt = "mouse gathering nuts">

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And now, (thought she), I shall certainly be caught by
the great white owl; for he will be able to see me now; and I
can&rsquo;t hide myself under the long grass and dandelions, as I used
to do, for they are all cut down and spoiled.&rsquo;&mdash;Poor little
Downy was in a great fright all the time that the hay-makers were at
work, and when she found them coming near her house, with their great
pitchforks in their hands, she remembered the fate of her mother, and
all her brothers and sisters in the stack, and she thought that she
should be safer in the
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
bank of the garden hedge; which was not far off. She watched an
opportunity when no one was looking, and hastened away to the hedge as
fast as she could, and creeping in laid quite snug; she remained in the
bank the whole day, and enjoyed herself more than could be expected, for
the weather was extremely pleasant, and there was a fine bed of ripe
wild strawberries close by, which smelt quite refreshing. Though Downy
dared not venture back into the field for fear of being killed (for mice
are but timid little things) yet she was very happy all that day; and
when she saw the men leave the field with the pitchforks which had
caused her so much terror, she returned to her nest, and slept that
night on some new hay which she had nibbled, and brought into her house
to lay on. As soon as it was day, away ran careful Downy to the bank;
she peeped through the hedge, and saw every thing in the garden looking
very pleasant. So Miss Downy thought she should like to spend this day
in the beautiful shady garden; in she went, and soon found it as
charming as it looked; for the garden abounded in plenty of good things;
there were peas, and beans, and potatoes, and young carrots, and beds of
ripe red strawberries. Downy did nothing but eat and enjoy herself the
whole day, and did not think of returning home that day, nor for many
days afterwards, for she said to herself&mdash;&lsquo;What
occasion&nbsp;is
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
there for me to go back to the meadow, where I have so much trouble to
get food, for here is more than I could ever eat, and I have no trouble
in getting it at all&mdash;and I am sure no mischief will happen to me
here!&rsquo; So she gave no thought of her nice house in the field, but
amused herself by eating all the day long; till she grew quite fat, and
Downy thought she was happier than ever she had been in the field, and
she grew very indolent, for she now began to think that there was no
occasion for her to work, but she said to herself, she would play all
day; and here she shewed herself to be a very simple little mouse, (as
it proved in what befel her). She had been living in the garden for
nearly a month, when one fine sunshiny day, she had ventured nearer to
the house than usual, and was lying reposing herself in the sun by a
clod of dirt, near a rain-water butt, when she was disturbed by a noise
near her, and to her horror she beheld the black cat with a fine kitten
by her side, proceeding down the walk where she lay; to escape was
almost impossible, even the attempt was vain, and hapless Downy gave
herself up for lost. A&nbsp;month back, and she might have trusted to
her own speed for escaping&mdash;but, alas! Downy had so long been used
to do nothing but eat and enjoy herself, that she was no longer able to
run as swiftly as she used to do; she dared not even move a step, and
sat in an agony of hopeless despair.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<p>&ldquo;Downy now lamented her folly in having left her safe retreat
in the meadow: what would she now have given to have been in her own
little house under the mole hill? and she bitterly regretted ever having
been tempted to quit it, for there no cats ever came, and there she had
lived in innocence and happiness, whilst now she was doomed to fall a
victim to the merciless claws of a hungry cat, who would devour her
alive: she lay breathless! not a limb did she move, scarce did she even
draw her breath, for the cat approached within a yard of the spot where
she laid, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! poor Downy! (cried
Alfred,) how sorry I am!&mdash;but, mamma, did that wicked cat kill her?
do, dear mamma, make haste and tell me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why,
Alfred,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;you would not wait for me to tell
you whether she was killed or not: I&nbsp;am sure you could not feel
sorry for the death of a <i>nasty brown mouse</i>; you hate mice, they
are such little thieves.&rdquo;&mdash;Little Alfred blushed at what his
mother said, for he remembered they were his own words, and said to his
mother, &ldquo;Dear mamma, I&nbsp;think I will never wish for the death
of any thing again, and I am very sorry I had that mouse killed;
I&nbsp;will never kill another mouse, if it was to eat all the cakes you
mean to give me when I am a good boy.&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford not help
smiling at her little boy, but went&nbsp;on.&mdash;</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>&ldquo;The cat, as I said before, was close to the clod&nbsp;of
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
earth on which luckless Downy stood, and when she believed her death
certain, she had the inexpressible joy of finding that her motionless
posture had been the means of saving her from the vigilant eyes of the
cat, who passed on quite unconcerned without taking any notice of her
prey. For an instant Downy could scarce credit her own eyes when she saw
her enemy pass on; but fearing that if puss should return, she should
not again escape so miraculously, she darted away as she hoped unseen,
but, silly little thing! she had better have laid where she was, for the
kitten beheld her as she ran, and sprung upon her. Poor
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
Downy felt her claws, but exerting all her speed, she flew to the
hedge&mdash;this friendly hedge which had so often been her refuge, and
darting among the tangled roots of the hawthorn and ivy, left her
pursuers far behind, and, exhausted with terror and fatigue, remained
trembling and panting till she was half dead. Still she heard the mews
of the disappointed kitten, and the angry purrs of the old cat&mdash;who
sat watching about the bank for more than an hour, waiting to seize her
if she ventured forth,<a class = "tag" name = "tag" id = "tag" href =
"#note">*</a> but that poor Downy was not in a condition to do, for her
poor back still ached with the bruise the kitten had given her, and she
felt in such a panic, she could not have stirred a step if she had seen
a dozen cats. For two whole days poor little Downy thought she should
have died, and when she was a little better and began to feel hungry,
there was nothing for her to eat but hay seeds and ivy leaves, or the
roots of the trees, and Downy, who had of late been used to such good
fare, could not bear to eat such dry unpalatable food as this was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she used to spend her time in labour and
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
industry, she eat the hardest fare with an excellent appetite, and was
thankful and contented with the least bit of any thing she got, but now
she turned away disgusted at the coarse food, and it was not until
pinched by hunger, that she would eat any of it. And now Downy began to
consider within herself, whether it would not have been much better and
wiser for her to have returned back to her own house in the meadow,
instead of living so long in idleness and luxury; and Downy found that
idleness brings its own punishment sooner or later, for had she been at
home she would not have been so frightened by the cat, or nearly killed
by the kitten; or even if a cat had come near her nice nest, she would
have run away much faster than she did now, for being then smaller and
thinner, she was much nimbler; nor was her daintiness the least evil
that attended her long indulgence, and this she felt more severely now
she was ill and could not go out to find good food; she had suffered so
much with pain and terror, that she resolved never to go into the garden
again, excepting to get provisions when in want. With a sad and penitent
heart Downy once more returned to her old habitation, but, alas! what
was her grief on beholding it a complete ruin; her nice warm nest all
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'destoyed'">destroyed</ins>,
and the pretty green mound quite spoiled! Downy was sadly vexed, for
the cruel hay-makers had with their pitchforks torn open the
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
turf and scattered her soft bed all round on the grass. She stood gazing
with anguish on the desolate scene before her; here was all her spring
work entirely ruined, and now she was ill and had no where to lay her
head. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought she, &lsquo;if I had not spent so much
time in doing nothing but eating and playing, I&nbsp;should have escaped
the danger of being caught by the cat, and should not have been hurt by
the kitten, besides which I think by this time I might have made up my
nest, and have been quite comfortable again. <!-- close quote missing
--> She was hardly able to work, and what was far worse, she felt very
great reluctance to begin her laborious task, so much harm had her
living so long in indolence done her, as it does to every one who
indulges in it. Remember, my little Alfred, that idleness is the root of
all evil, as you may see in the case of Downy:&mdash;now which do you
think was the happiest and best,&mdash;careful and industrious Downy
making her house, and busily procuring food for herself against the
winter,&mdash;or careless idle Downy doing nothing but playing and
enjoying herself in the garden, eating the fruit, and sleeping among the
flowers? now tell me, which do you like best of the two?&rdquo; Alfred
considered for a minute or two, and then said, &ldquo;Why, dear mamma,
though I should have liked to have eaten the nice things in the garden,
and lived among the flowers, yet I see that it would have been better
for Downy if she had always remained in the
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
field and worked hard; but I am afraid I should have been as silly as
Downy, and not liked work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I was afraid of, therefore, my dear child,
I&nbsp;thought it best to shew you how wrong she was in indulging
herself in that manner; and be assured that, whoever does so, will fall
into <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'misfortue'">misfortune</ins>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Necessity obliged Downy at last to overcome her extreme
reluctance to work, and she once more began to look out for a proper
place for her new habitation; she visited all the green mounds in the
meadow, but alas! they were occupied by the ant, and poor Downy was
quite out of patience&mdash;and at last she was, though with reluctance,
forced to take up her lodgings in the side of the garden bank, quite at
the farther end, where no cats ever came, and at last, finding it was to
her own interest to work, she resolved not to be idle any more, and
laboured as hard as ever she had done, and soon completed her new
dwelling, having made it a most commodious habitation, in which she
lived very happily all the summer. When the harvest time arrived, then
was Downy very busy; she went into a neighbouring wheat field, and there
she made a good harvest for herself, and laid in a handsome store of
grain for her winter supply. In her journeys to the corn-fields she met
many mice, who, like her, were gathering in their winter stock of
provisions; but Downy would not stay in the corn-fields, because she
remembered
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
the fate of her nest while she was gone in the garden, so she came home
very regularly every night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of any consequence happened to Miss Downy till the
latter end of the Autumn; for some days she had missed her provisions,
but could not account for it in any way, and was at a loss to know who
it could be that devoured the fruits of her daily labour, but one
morning when she returned from gleaning in the stubble-fields, she was
greatly surprised, on entering her house, to behold a young stranger
busily employed in breakfasting in her granery; she
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
stopped at the entrance of her house to examine her visitor, and was
struck by the beauty of his form; he was of a reddish colour, his hair
very long and thick, his breast and fore-feet of a pale buff, and his
belly white; he had a nice round face, and small oval ears, with quick
lively brown eyes and long handsome black whiskers; in short, he was the
prettiest mouse Downy had ever seen, though he was a sad little thief,
and had eaten a great deal of her store. He appeared at first much
disconcerted at being disturbed and discovered in his depredation, and
looked round on every side for an opening to escape at, but none
appearing, he stood still, and scratched his ear with one of his hind
feet, assuming as unconcerned an air as he could possibly put on; Downy
was not sorry she had discovered who was the thief, but she soon forgave
him, though she could not help thinking he was a very dishonest mouse to
come every day and rob her as he had done, but he was so pretty, and
made so humble an apology for his intruding into her <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads 'kouse'">house</ins>, that she could
not find it in her heart to be angry with him long, and they soon became
very good friends, and at last he proposed her taking him as a partner,
which the simple Downy agreed to without hesitation, and shared her
house and provisions with the handsome young stranger, who behaved with
great decorum for some time, and was very careful to mind what Downy
said to him,
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
but at last he began to throw off his restraint, and was often getting
into mischief in spite of the sage advice of Downy, who took great pains
to warn him from such evil practices; but Silket would frisk in the
garden, robbing the newly-planted bean and pea crops with the greatest
audacity, not minding what careful Downy said, who represented to him
the danger he run of being killed by cats, or mousehunts, or caught in
traps; but Silket, like a naughty mouse as he was, only laughed and made
light of her fears; and when at last she appeared vexed at his
disobedience, he promised never to go into the garden again; but, like
many more, he broke his promise directly he was out of her sight; and
beside this, he was sadly idle, and was I am sorry to say, much fonder
of play than work, and Downy was obliged to remonstrate with him on such
bad behaviour, and said, &lsquo;Silket, how can you expect me to work
for both you and myself? you are a sad partner. <!-- close quote missing
--> Silket was very humble, and promised to be more industrious for the
future, and that very afternoon he ransacked a new crop of peas, which
the gardener had sown that day, and came home laden with the spoils;
next day he brought <ins class = "correction" title = "missing word 'a'?">home hoard</ins>
of nuts from the garden, and Downy thought if he would but continue so
good, she should be very happy, for her Silket was a very pretty
creature, and she was very fond of him. But pretty creatures are not
always the best, as she
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
soon found to her cost, for when the weather set in cold, then Mr.
Silket refused to work, or even to stir out of the house, but lay rolled
round like a ball in the soft hay, and slept, only just getting up to
eat; and Downy was much grieved, for she feared their stock of food
would never last out the winter, if he did not help her make some
addition to it, but Silket begged her not to be under any concern, for
there was plenty for them both; and on her again expressing her fears on
the subject, he gave her two or three severe bites on her ear, and
squeaked most vehemently, shewing his anger at being found fault with,
and then laid down again with a sulky air of displeasure; while poor
Downy almost broken-hearted, slowly and full of sorrow, left her house,
and strolled along the side of the bank quite disconsolate, and she
resolved never to go back again to her ungrateful husband, who had
treated her so unkindly, but leave him in quiet possession of her
dwelling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple little Downy! she might have known beforehand how he
would have treated her, as she was so well acquainted with his
propensity to stealing, and she was a very foolish mouse to take for a
partner one who shewed, from the first, that he liked better to play
about and steal, than to labour and get an honest living. Downy ought to
have considered all this, but she thought him so pretty, that she forgot
all his
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
misdeeds, and very imprudently shared her food and house with him. It is
true, that he promised very fair, and said he would work for her, and
that she should have nothing to do but just to eat, and sleep, and play;
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has '(and Downy who'">and Downy
(who</ins> did not think that such a pretty soft creature could tell so
many stories) believed all he said, and this was the consequence of her
imprudence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see, Alfred, that we must not always judge by
appearances, because I know rather a pretty creature, with bright blue
eyes, who, like Silket, can steal, and tell fibs, and who likes to play
better than learn a lesson and read.&rdquo; Alfred coloured up, for he
knew all along that his mother meant he was like Silket; so he felt a
little ashamed, and did not make any answer; and his mother continued
her story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Downy laid bewailing her sad misfortune in the
cold damp grass, determining never to go home to her little tyrant
again, so angry was she at his cruel conduct.&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! foolish
mouse that I was, (said she), why did not I continue to live by myself
when I was so happy! I&nbsp;might have known how he would have behaved
to me, but I will never return to him, he may enjoy by himself that food
which he loves so much more than he does me, ungrateful that he
is!&rsquo; In this manner she was uttering her complaints, when she
heard a soft padding step behind her, and a mournful noise made her turn
round, and
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
she beheld her penitent Silket, (for it was him) who advancing with a
sorrowful air, humbly besought her forgiveness, and rubbed his velvet
cheek in an imploring manner against her&rsquo;s; his lively brown eyes
were now troubled, and very sorrowful. Downy could not resist his
beseeching looks, but forgave him for all his past offences, and took
him once more into favour, on his promising to be good in future and
never to bite her ears or tail again. Silket was very sorry for his late
bad behaviour, and he resolved to be very good and do so no more, for he
did love Downy very much, though he loved himself better. He accompanied
her home with great affection, and they were happier for some weeks than
they had ever been before; he was so attentive and kind, and seemed to
study only to please her; he spent day after day in searching among the
dry leaves in the garden for filberts; and when he could not procure any
thing else, he brought her crocus roots, and carrots out of the
garden.</p>

<p><!-- open quote missing --> One evening he had been out later than
usual, he did not see Downy&rsquo;s bright eyes looking out from among
the dry leaves and moss for his return, and he was fearful some ill had
befallen her. As he approached the house, he thought he heard several
little squeaking sounds, and on entering his nest, found that Downy in
his absence had become the mother of four <ins class = "correction"
title = "error uncorrected because it was irresistible">ittle</ins>
helpless blind mice, which she was suckling<ins class = "correction"
title = ", for .">. &nbsp;</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
Silket was overjoyed, he licked the little ones with much affection, and
behaved with the greatest tenderness to Downy; he presented her the
filbert he had brought home, and praised the beauty of his little
family, though none but himself could see that they possessed any, for
little mice are very ugly till they can open their eyes, and have got
fur on them; for like puppies, and kittens, and rabbits, they are all
born blind, and do not open their eyes for many days after.</p>

<p><!-- open quote missing --> No mouse could behave better than Silket
now did; he would not suffer Downy to stir out in the cold, on any
account, for, though it was the latter end of March, the weather was
unusually severe, and the frost very hard; Silket was out almost the
whole day searching for nice food for Downy, and getting soft moss to
keep his young ones warm,&mdash;but one day he grieved Downy much and
did a deal of mischief,&mdash;he wanted something to cover his little
ones with, and what did he do, but went into the garden to the hedge
where Mrs. Ball had hung out her linen to dry, and the wicked Silket
gnawed and bit one of the old lady&rsquo;s white aprons almost to
pieces, carrying home as many of the rags as his mouth would hold, to
his house. Downy was sadly vexed when she heard what he had been doing,
and she was forced to read him a very long lecture on being so
mischievous, while Mr. Mischief amused himself by laying the
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
rags out to the greatest advantage, admiring the white quilt he had
brought home for his little ones&rsquo; bed, and secretly resolving to
go and fetch the remaining fragments, and though he saw how grave Downy
looked, he did not think he had done so much harm in biting the old
lady&rsquo;s apron; so he cast a cunning eye at Downy, to see if she was
observing him, for he wanted sadly to get the rest of the apron<ins
class = "correction" title = ", invisible">, </ins>only he did not like
to disoblige her commands, and get another scolding; but she saw what he
was after, and she begged him not to go, for she said, she knew that
such mischievous ways would come to no good end, and that he would get
caught in a trap, or killed by some cat, or fall into some great danger,
&lsquo;And, (added she,) what should I do, Silket, left with these four
helpless little mice to provide for?&rsquo; Silket immediately saw the
impropriety of his conduct, and he never spoiled any more of good Mrs.
Ball&rsquo;s linen, though he often came in the way of it. The poor old
lady was greatly disturbed at the misfortune which had befallen her best
muslin apron, and threatened to have the ratcatcher&rsquo;s dogs and
ferrets to hunt the garden and the hedge, if any thing more was
destroyed; so that it was a good thing that Silket took Downy&rsquo;s
advice in that respect, or he would certainly have been killed for his
pains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of three weeks the little mice began to be quite
lively, and to grow very pretty little creatures;
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
they much resembled their father in his <ins class = "correction" title
= "spelling unchanged">mischeivous</ins> inclinations, and it needed all
Downy&rsquo;s prudent management to keep them in order, for they would
frisk out of their nest, and scud about in the meadow, going so for out
of sight, and staying so late, that Downy was in a great fright lest any
mishap should befall them, as to Silket, he seemed to take great delight
in their pranks.</p>

<p>They would lay on the bank, enjoying themselves and basking in the
sun, almost all day long. When it was fine weather, sometimes, one
bolder than the rest would run up a little tree not more than a yard
high, and clinging to the top, look down with triumph on his companions;
then, if he heard the dead leaves shake, the timid little thing whisked
down, and away they all four scudded, hiding themselves in the holes of
the hedge, till they thought the danger past.</p>

<p>Downy now began to feel the cares of a family, and she was often much
grieved at the disobedient behaviour of the little mice. Velvet was the
only good-behaved one, and she was bad enough in all reason. They were
incorrigible little thieves, which quality they inherited from their
father, for no sooner were their parents out of the way, than they found
their way to the granary, and though Downy and Silket were all day
busied in getting food for them, and fed them with the best of every
thing, the wicked
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
little things stole the corn, and eat even more than they wanted; they
grew so fat and sleek and wanton, that all the field-mice in the meadow
declared they were quite spoiled, and Downy ought to keep them under
more restraint, and punish them when they behaved ill. As they grew
older they grew worse and worse; Downy had warned them of all the
dangers which they ran in roaming so far from home, and told them of the
cat that haunted the garden, and of the mousehunt, and the great white
owl, but these bad mice paid no attention to what their kind good mother
said to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among other things, she begged them not to go near the brick
traps which the gardener had set among the beans and peas, to entice
simple mice to eat the bait, and then they were sure to be killed, by
the trap falling on them; but they did not regard those prudent counsels
in the least, and a day or two after, they all sallied out into the
garden, (with Whitefoot, their leader) in search of something nice.
After they had rummaged the ground under the nut-tree for some time
without finding a single nut, they came to a row of late-sown peas;
these they made a terrible havoc amongst, regardless of their
mother&rsquo;s advice. They were going home, well pleased with their
regale, when, unluckily, Whitefoot espied a parcel of nice wheat, laid
out very carefully under a sort of brick house; now Whitefoot run all
round&nbsp;it
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
and thought it stood too firm to be knocked down, and as he was rather
greedy, he determined to venture under, and eat up the wheat; he was in
such a hurry, for fear that either of his companions should come and
want to share his prize, that, in his haste, he pushed down a bit of a
stick which held the brick up&mdash;down it fell, and hapless Whitefoot
was crushed to death in an instant.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "farmer giving dead mouse to cat">

<p>&ldquo;This was the <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">effects</ins>
of his disobedience to his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noise of the fallen brick alarmed the timid
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
little mice; away they ran as fast as they could, nor did they once stop
to look behind to see what had become of their brother Whitefoot, who
was found next morning by the gardener, under the brick, and was given
to the black cat to eat. Now had he minded what his mother had told him
the day before, he would have been alive and frisking about with the
rest. See, Alfred, what comes of disobedience and greediness.&rdquo;
said his mother. &ldquo;Yes, mamma, (said Alfred) I&nbsp;will remember
how poor Whitefoot was served, and not disobey you, though you know,
I&nbsp;could not be killed by a brick trap as he was.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
Alfred, but you might get hurt in a hundred different ways by going
where I bid you not&mdash;recollect when I had so often told you not to
play with the fire, how you burnt your hand, by lighting bits of paper;
and if I had not come in, you would have been burnt to death.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, mamma, and it hurt me so much, I&nbsp;have never done it
since.&rdquo; &ldquo;No more would Whitefoot have gone near a trap
again, if he had only broken one of his limbs, instead of being killed,
but he should have minded what was said at first. But you shall hear how
the others behaved after his death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Downy was much shocked at the death of her poor Whitefoot, and
she told the other little mice to take warning by their brother&rsquo;s
sad fate, and not go near any more brick traps, but be contented with
the food
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
which she and their father provided for them. This they promised to do,
and they were very sorry for the loss of Whitefoot, who was the most
nimble of them all, and at the head of all their pranks, for he was
usually the ring-leader and the most daring of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a few days they were more orderly, but their bad habits
returned again, and they forgot all their promises, and were as naughty
as ever they had been&mdash;even Silket was shocked at them, and was
forced to chastise the two most unruly, by biting their ears. Wilful run
away, and came to a most untimely death.&mdash;He invaded, one night,
a&nbsp;bee-hive, and made great havoc in the stores of honey, eating the
honey-combs, and destroying the work of the poor bees&mdash;but at last
he was punished severely, for the bees, enraged at his lawless conduct,
came in a body, and stung their enemy in a thousand different places, so
that, unable to escape, he died in great agony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did bees ever sting a mouse to death in that manner,
mamma?&rdquo; asked Alfred. &ldquo;Yes, Alfred, and if you are a good
boy, I&nbsp;will read you a long account of bees, and how they build
their cells, and make their wax and honey.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, mamma,
there is nothing about their killing a mouse in it, is there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, my dear child, I&nbsp;will tell you all about it one day,
but let me finish my story first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were now only two young mice left, Velvet and Sprightly.
Velvet was so shocked at the bad end which her two brothers had come to,
that she resolved not to be naughty again, but try by her good conduct,
to make amends for her thoughtless behaviour&mdash;but when she told
Sprightly of her intentions, the wicked Sprightly ridiculed her, and
said she should go and seek her fortune in the meadow and garden, where
no one could scold her, and where she might do as she pleased; and with
this resolution she set off, and they never saw her again; for having
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
no house to go to, the white owl saw her as he was flying out one
evening, and soon made an end of Miss Sprightly, who had better have
staid at home with Velvet, and her father and mother. Velvet was the
comfort and pride of her parents; she helped them in all their labours,
and assisted them in enlarging their house, and providing food against
the winter. As she encreased in goodness, she grew prettier, and every
one admired her, she was so clean, and her skin was as soft as satin, and looked quite bright and
glossy<ins class = "correction" title = ", for . at line-end: see following error">. </ins>Velvet

enjoyed being out in the dew; she always returned home loaded with grain;
and they were all quite happy and comfortable; for Silket was very good,
and Downy had nothing to make her uncomfortable, being blessed with a
good husband and a good daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a sad accident happened which deprived poor Downy of all
means of providing for her wants, and gave Silket and Velvet the
greatest pain and uneasiness on her account. One day, Downy had been by
herself in the garden, and in passing under a gooseberry bush, she did
not see a trap which had been set to catch little birds, and it caught
one of her poor little feet, and she lay struggling in the greatest
pain, and shrieking lamentably&mdash;at last by a violent effort, she
got loose, but with the loss of one of her fore-feet. Sadly wounded, and
crying piteously, she at last
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
gained her home, and Silket and Velvet found her exhausted with pain,
and almost dying; they were greatly grieved at the misfortune, and
lamented bitterly the sad fate of poor Downy, and they feared greatly
lest they should lose her, but good nursing and great care at last
restored her, in some measure, after which Velvet and Silket would never
permit her to go out to get food, but always brought the best for her,
and she lived quite at her ease, only she never was so strong as
before.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/p43.jpg" width = "334" height = "293"

<p>&ldquo;Velvet strove by all the means in her power,&nbsp;to
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
make her mother happy; that she might not feel her misfortune so
severely; and she succeeded so well that Downy became quite cheerful and
contented, and never complained or repined at her lameness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Summer passed happily away, but the sudden death of poor
Silket, once more filled them with grief. The innocent little creature
was sleeping under the nut-trees in the garden, one warm morning in
September; he had been collecting nuts to carry home, but being tired,
he laid down to repose himself in the sun, and unfortunately fell
asleep, nor did he wake till he found himself in the grasp of the
merciless black cat, who springing upon her defenceless prey, strangled
him in an instant. There was no fond Downy near, nor affectionate
Velvet, to receive his last sighs, nor give him aid. The evening came,
but no Silket returned to the disconsolate Downy; another day passed,
but they saw nothing of Silket, and they were at last certain that he
must have been killed. This heavy blow almost overcame Downy, and it was
with the greatest difficulty, Velvet could persuade her to eat and be
comforted; but every thing around them served to recall the image, and
remind them of the loss, of their beloved Silket, and this gave them
both great pain. At last, Velvet, without saying any thing to her
mother, stole away while she was asleep, and having found a pretty spot,
some way from farmer Ball&rsquo;s land, she made a new
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
house, much more convenient than the one they then lived in; it was a
long time before it was completed, but when it was quite finished, and
well stocked with grain, she brought Downy to see it: it was situated in
a pretty garden, on a beautiful sloping green bank, under the shade of a
fir tree, not many yards from a nice white brick house, the front of
which was covered with vines and wall-fruit; there were pots of balsams
and geraniums, placed on the beds opposite the windows and glass
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mamma, (exclaimed Alfred, suddenly

garden, saying with great vivacity, &ldquo;Yes, mamma, it is the same;
it is our garden with the fir-tree and the bank, and all the flowers,
exactly the same<ins class = "correction" title = "? for !">!&rdquo;</ins>
And he turned an inquiring eye unto his mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford smiled, but made no reply to his exclamations of
surprise, and went on as if she had not heard him. &ldquo;In this quiet
pretty spot they settled themselves, and Downy hoped to spend the rest
of her days in quiet; she wanted for nothing, for Velvet provided for
all her wants. Downy thought, if she should ever be deprived of her, it
would break her heart, and she must soon be starved to death, as she
could not work now, as she had done formerly. These thoughts made her
often very sorrowful, and Velvet thought she seemed to droop, and lose
her spirits and appetite, so Velvet thought to get something nice to
please her; she stole into the house one day, when nobody saw her, and
after some little time, she found her way into the cupboard, where she
smelt something very nice, and beheld a new plum-cake. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;how my sick mother will like a bit of this cake!&rsquo;
so having made a hearty meal herself off it, she carried away the rest
for her mother, not thinking she had done any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, mamma, (cried Alfred with tears in his
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
eyes,) how I wish I had not set the trap to catch that good Velvet; she
might have had my cake, and welcome, if I had but known what she took it
for, how sorry I am! I&nbsp;wish Velvet was alive again, with all my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not I tell you, Alfred, you would be sorry for killing the
<i>nasty brown mouse</i>, before the day was over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, dear mamma, and so I am indeed; I&nbsp;wish you had
told me the story before, and then I should not have set the
trap.&mdash;And so I suppose poor Downy will die, because she has no one
to feed her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Alfred, shall I finish my story? <!-- close quote
missing --></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you please, mamma, but you don&rsquo;t know any more
of it, do you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only this, when Downy found Velvet did not
return, she died of grief. Thus ended the <span class = "smallcaps">Life
and Adventures of The Field-mouse</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, mamma,&rdquo; cried Alfred, bursting into tears,
&ldquo;what a cruel boy I have been! I&nbsp;have killed both Downy and
Velvet&mdash;I&nbsp;will never be so cruel again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford, charmed with the sensibility of her little boy, kissed
him most tenderly, saying, &ldquo;Dry your tears, my sweet Alfred, and
resolve not to be so desirous of the death of a little animal again.
Though it is very necessary to kill them sometimes, or they would soon
destroy all our food and clothes; still when we are forced from
necessity to kill any
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
thing, we should do it with as much humanity as we can, and never
inflict on them unnecessary pain. I&nbsp;should myself have been forced
to set the trap for Velvet, only I did not like to see my little Alfred,
merely from revenge, wishing so eagerly for the death of a poor mouse,
who did not know it was doing any harm in eating the cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfred kissed his mother, and thanked her for her kindness in telling
him the story; and wiping his tears away, went into the garden to play
till tea was ready.</p>

The above-mentioned circumstance, improbable as it may appear,
I&nbsp;myself was witness to in the garden not many paces from the door
of the house; when the poor little mouse actually escaped the eyes of a
cat and her kitten, who passed within a yard of the spot where it stood,
by standing in that motionless manner on the top of a clod of earth, nor
was it discovered till it left its station, and though caught by the
kitten, yet it finally escaped unhurt to the garden hedge.</p>
